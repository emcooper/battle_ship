    "The basic object of the game of Battleship is to hide your ship fleet \n
    somewhere on your grid and by calling out basic coordinates, \n
    find your opponentâ€™s fleet before they find yours. You will take turns\n
    selecting coordinates to 'hit'. When all coordinates of a ship have been\n
    hit the ship has been 'sunk'. The first person to sink all of the other player's\n
    ships wins the game.\n
