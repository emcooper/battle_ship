    "The basic object of the game of Battleship is to hide your ship fleet
somewhere on your grid and by calling out basic coordinates,
find your opponentâ€™s fleet before they find yours. You will take turns
selecting coordinates to 'hit'. When all coordinates of a ship have been
hit the ship has been 'sunk'. The first person to sink all of the other player's
ships wins the game.\n
